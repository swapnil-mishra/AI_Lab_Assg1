# 8-Puzzle Solver (BFS and DFS)

This project implements a simple 8-puzzle solver using Breadth-First Search (BFS) and depth-limited Depth-First Search (DFS).

Files:
- `solver.py`: main script that generates a random solvable initial grid and runs BFS and DFS.

- `puzzle_solver.py`: main script (concise variable names) that generates a random solvable initial grid and runs BFS and DFS.

Usage:
- Run `python puzzle_solver.py` with Python 3.

Notes:
- DFS depth limit is set to 30 by default.
- The script prints number of steps, nodes explored, and time taken for each algorithm.

Submission:
- Zip all required files and name the zip file as `roll_no.zip` before uploading to the course form.
